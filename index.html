            <h1>The Kentucky Mathematics Association of Two-Year Colleges</h1>
            <p>  The Kentucky Mathematics Association of Two-Year Colleges is a statewide organization open to teachers of mathematics on the college level and to all other persons who share an interest in mathematics.  KYMATYC goals include establishing and maintaining consistency in course content and placement, dialoguing about the success and/or failure of innovations, offering professional development opportunities, exchanging information about available positions, and providing the opportunity for collegial exchange.</p>
                
            <p> KYMATYC is active in state decisions about issues affecting the teaching and learning of mathematics at the community college level and keeps its members informed about those issues with newsletters and this web site.  A conference is held every March with locations rotating between state parks.  Past locations include Shaker Village, Pleasant Hill, Kentucky as well as Rough River State Park and Dale Hollow State Park.  Recently, KYMATYC was held in Berea, KY at the Historic Boone Tavern Hotel.  KYMATYC is an active affiliate of AMATYC, the national association.</p>
